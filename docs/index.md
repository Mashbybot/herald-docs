## 🏹 Why Herald?

Herald was built from the ground up for Hunter: The Reckoning 5th Edition. Unlike generic dice bots, Herald understands H5E mechanics:

- **H5E-Native**: Designed specifically for Hunter, not adapted from other systems
- **Character Integration**: Roll using your character's actual stats
- **Edge & Desperation**: Full implementation of H5E's unique mechanics
- **Beginner Friendly**: Clear commands, helpful errors, and in-Discord help
- **Always Improving**: Regular updates based on community feedback

## 🎯 Example: Quick Roll

```
/roll_char character:Raven attribute:Dexterity skill:Firearms difficulty:2
```

Herald automatically:
- Looks up your character "Raven"
- Gets their Dexterity and Firearms ratings
- Rolls the combined pool
- Checks for successes vs. difficulty 2
- Displays results with Edge/Desperation if applicable
