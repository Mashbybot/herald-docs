## Character Optimization

### Maximizing Dice Pools

**The 8-Dice Threshold:**
- 8+ dice pools have high success rates
- Target: Primary attribute 4 + Primary skill 4 = 8 dice
- Secondary pools: 5-7 dice
- Tertiary pools: 3-4 dice acceptable

**Optimization path:**

**Starting (0 XP):**
- Dexterity 4, Firearms 4 = 8 dice (shooting)
- Intelligence 3, Investigation 3 = 6 dice (clues)
- Manipulation 2, Persuasion 2 = 4 dice (social)

**Early (20 XP):**
- Raise Firearms to 5 = 9 dice shooting (10 XP)
- Add 2 specialties (6 XP)
- Save 4 XP

**Mid (50 XP):**
- Raise Dexterity to 5 = 10 dice shooting (20 XP)
- Raise Investigation to 4 = 7 dice investigating (8 XP)
- Buy second Edge (15 XP)
- Remaining: 7 XP

### Attribute Priority

## Desperation Management

### When to Use Desperation

**Always use when:**
- Character death is imminent
- Ally is dying
- Mission-critical roll (one chance)
- Final confrontation with major threat

**Usually use when:**
- Danger is low (0-3)
- Success is very important
- Failure has severe consequences
- Storyteller hints it's needed

**Rarely use when:**
- Danger is high (7-10)
- Roll is not critical
- Other options exist
- You're already in Despair

**Never use when:**
- Routine tasks
- Low-stakes situations
- You can afford to fail
- Risk of Despair > reward

### Danger Management

**Keep Danger low:**
- Rest and downtime (-1 per session)
- Complete Redemption paths
- Avoid unnecessary Desperation use
- Ask Storyteller for Danger reduction opportunities

**Monitor thresholds:**
- **0-3:** Safe to use Desperation
- **4-6:** Caution advised
- **7-9:** High risk
- **10:** Extreme danger

**Danger reduction tactics:**
- Narrative downtime between arcs
- Completing personal storylines
- Redemption paths
- Storyteller rewards

### Overreach Decisions

**When you Overreach (Success + Desperation 1s):**

**Choose success when:**
- You can handle the Danger increase
- Success is worth the cost
- You're at low Danger already
- Mission success > personal safety

**Choose Despair when:**
- Danger is already high (8+)
- Failure advances character story
- Redemption path is interesting
- You want dramatic character moment

**Example:**
```
Danger 2, roll 6 successes, 2 Desperation 1s
Choose: Keep 6 successes + gain Danger 2 (total Danger 4)
Reason: Danger 4 is still safe, success is critical
```

### Despair Strategy

**Embrace Despair narratively:**
- Don't avoid it out of fear
- It's a feature, not a punishment
- Creates great character moments
- Drives personal stories

**Plan Redemption:**
- Work with Storyteller
- Tie to your Drive
- Make it meaningful
- Use it to advance character arc

**Redemption examples:**

**Vengeance Drive in Despair:**
- Redemption: Hunt down and hurt your quarry
- Approach: 1-2 session mini-arc
- Completion: Dramatic confrontation

**Virtue Drive in Despair:**
- Redemption: Uphold morals despite darkness
- Approach: Moral dilemma, choose right path
- Completion: Resist temptation

## Combat Tactics

### Action Economy

**Maximize effectiveness per turn:**
- Attack with highest pool
- Position for next turn
- Coordinate with allies
- Don't waste actions on low-probability moves

### Positioning

**Use environment:**
- Cover: Increases difficulty to hit you
- High ground: Bonus to attack
- Choke points: Limit enemy movement
- Escape routes: Always have one

**Describe tactics:**
- "I take cover behind the car" = +1 difficulty to hit you
- "I flank while they're distracted" = -1 difficulty to hit
- "I climb to the roof" = high ground advantage

### Focus Fire

**Concentrate attacks:**
- All Hunters attack one target
- Eliminate threats quickly
- Reduces enemy action economy
- Protects wounded allies

**Priority targets:**
1. **Healers/support** - Eliminate first
2. **High damage dealers** - Remove threats
3. **Weak enemies** - Easy kills
4. **Leaders** - Disrupt coordination

### Desperation in Combat

**Critical moments:**
```
/roll pool:8 difficulty:4 desperate:true comment:Killing blow on vampire lord
```

**Don't waste on:**
- Minions
- Early fight rounds
- When allies can succeed
- If you're at high Danger

### Defensive Tactics

**Dodge vs. Tank:**
- **Dodge:** Dexterity + Athletics (avoid damage)
- **Tank:** Stamina + Resolve (absorb damage)
- High Dex = dodge
- High Stamina = tank

**When to retreat:**
- Health below 3
- Willpower depleted
- Allies down
- Outnumbered 3-to-1 or more
