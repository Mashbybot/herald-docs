# Creeds & Drives

Your **Creed** defines your hunting philosophy and methods. Your **Drive** explains why you hunt. Together, they shape your character's identity and provide mechanical benefits through the Redemption system.

## What are Drives?

**Drives** are the emotional or psychological reasons you hunt. While your Creed is *how* you hunt, your Drive is *why* you hunt.

Each Drive has an associated **Redemption** - the action that can restore you when you enter Despair.

### The Seven Drives

- **Curiosity** 🔍 - You hunt to learn
- **Vengeance** ⚔️ - You hunt to punish
- **Oath** 🤝 - You hunt because you swore to
- **Greed** 💰 - You hunt for profit
- **Pride** 👑 - You hunt to prove yourself
- **Envy** 💚 - You hunt what you can't have
- **Atonement** 🕊️ - You hunt to redeem yourself

---

## Drive & Redemption Details

### Curiosity 🔍
**Drive:** You hunt to understand the supernatural

You need to know. What are vampires? How do werewolves work? What makes ghosts persist? The mystery of the supernatural compels you to hunt and study it.

**Redemption:** Uncover new information about your quarry

When in Despair, learning something genuinely new about the monsters you hunt can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Discovering a vampire's true name
- Learning how a specific werewolf pack operates
- Finding an ancient text about your prey
- Understanding a monster's weakness

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Curiosity)

# After learning new information while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Vengeance ⚔️
**Drive:** You hunt to hurt those who hurt you

They took something from you - family, friends, your normal life. Now you hunt to make them pay. Every monster you hurt is justice for what was taken.

**Redemption:** Hurt your quarry

When in Despair, successfully injuring or damaging your prey can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Wounding the vampire that killed your family
- Destroying a monster's haven
- Killing one of their allies
- Inflicting meaningful harm

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Vengeance)

# After hurting your quarry while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Oath 🤝
**Drive:** You swore to hunt, and you keep your word

You made a promise - to a dying friend, to yourself, to a higher power. Your oath binds you to the hunt, and you will not break faith.

**Redemption:** Actively uphold or fulfill your oath

When in Despair, recommitting to your oath through meaningful action can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Honoring a promise you made
- Protecting what you swore to protect
- Following through on a commitment
- Staying true to your word under pressure

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Oath)

# After upholding your oath while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Greed 💰
**Drive:** You hunt for wealth, power, or resources

Monsters have resources - money, artifacts, territory. You hunt to take what they have. Maybe you need it, maybe you want it, but you're going to get it.

**Redemption:** Acquire resources from your enemies

When in Despair, successfully taking something valuable from monsters can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Looting a vampire's treasure
- Claiming a monster's territory
- Stealing a supernatural artifact
- Taking control of their assets

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Greed)

# After acquiring resources while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Pride 👑
**Drive:** You hunt to prove you're the best

You need to be the best Hunter, to excel, to prove your superiority. Every successful hunt proves you're better than the monsters - and better than other Hunters.

**Redemption:** Best your quarry in a contest

When in Despair, defeating your prey in a meaningful contest of skill can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Outsmarting a cunning vampire
- Defeating a monster in single combat
- Winning a battle of wits
- Proving superior in your specialty

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Pride)

# After besting your quarry while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Envy 💚
**Drive:** You hunt what you can't have

Monsters have what you want - immortality, power, freedom from human weakness. You hate them for having what you lack, and hunting them is an expression of that envy.

**Redemption:** Ally with your quarry

When in Despair, finding common ground or forming a temporary alliance with monsters can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Working with a vampire against a greater threat
- Understanding a monster's perspective
- Finding shared interests
- Temporary cooperation

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Envy)

# After allying with your quarry while in Despair:
/redemption
```

---

### Atonement 🕊️
**Drive:** You hunt to redeem past failures

You failed someone, or you were a monster yourself once. You hunt to make up for what you've done, to protect others from suffering as you or your victims did.

**Redemption:** Protect someone from your quarry

When in Despair, successfully saving someone from monsters can restore your Drive.

**Example:**
- Saving a victim from a vampire
- Protecting innocents from supernatural threats
- Preventing someone from suffering your fate
- Shielding others from harm

**Herald Commands:**
```
/drive action:set
(Select Atonement)

# After protecting someone while in Despair:
/redemption
```

## Using Drives for Recovery

### Normal Recovery (Not in Despair)

Pursuing your Drive provides narrative direction and can grant bonuses (Storyteller discretion).

### Recovery from Despair

When you're in Despair, completing your **Redemption** is the ONLY way to recover:

1. Enter Despair (through failed Desperation roll or choice)
2. Work toward your Redemption
3. Complete it (Storyteller confirms)
4. Use `/redemption` command
5. Drive restored, Despair removed

**Example:**
```
State: In Despair
Drive: Vengeance
Redemption: Hurt your quarry

Action: Successfully ambush and wound the vampire elder

Storyteller: "You definitely hurt him. That's Redemption."

Command: /redemption

Result: Despair removed, can use Desperation again
```
