# Status 👔

Authority. Position. Power. You have all three.

Status represents a Hunter's institutional authority and official position. Whether you're a police detective, government official, military officer, corporate executive, or religious authority, you have legitimate power that others must respect.

---

## Overview

### What is Status?

Status is an **Asset Edge** that grants authority within an institution or organization. You have a position of power that comes with privileges, access, resources, and the ability to give orders that must be obeyed.

The Edge operates on **institutional authority**: you're not just connected (like Contacts) or famous (like Fame) - you have actual legal/organizational power. You can issue commands, access resources, and exercise authority backed by your institution.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Authority figures** - Police, military, government
- **Defenders** - Protect through institutional power
- **Zealots** - Lead crusades with authority
- **Investigators** - Official access and resources
- **Leaders** - Command and direct others

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your character concept is anti-authority
- Your chronicle doesn't involve institutions
- You prefer operating outside the system
- Storyteller doesn't want official characters

### Key Strengths

- **Legal authority** - Power backed by law/organization
- **Resource access** - Official budgets and equipment
- **Information access** - Classified/restricted data
- **Command structure** - Give orders that are obeyed
- **Protection** - Institutional backing and support

### Limitations

- **Accountability** - Must answer to superiors
- **Bureaucracy** - Red tape and regulations
- **Public scrutiny** - Actions are recorded and reviewed
- **Chain of command** - Can't act completely independently
- **Institutional constraints** - Bound by organizational rules

Hunt benefits from official operations
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Status perk:Chain of Command

Your authority extends across your institution's jurisdiction. Access areas, question people, and exercise power throughout your domain.

**Authority Scope:**

```

**Herald Commands:**
```

**Example:**
```

Police respond, you're detained
Institutional Protection (Military):

- You're released with apology
Hunt incident covered by institution
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Status perk:Institutional Protection
```
