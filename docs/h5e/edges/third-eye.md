# Third Eye 👁️

See beyond the veil. The supernatural world reveals itself to you.

Third Eye represents the ability to perceive the supernatural realm directly - seeing ghosts, auras, magic, spirits, and the true nature of supernatural beings. While others stumble blind through a hidden world, you see it clearly.

---

## Overview

### What is Third Eye?

Third Eye is an **Endowment Edge** that grants supernatural perception - the ability to see, hear, and sense things beyond normal human capability. You perceive the occult world directly: ghosts walking among the living, auras revealing emotions and nature, magic crackling in the air, spirits invisible to others.

The Edge operates through **mystic sight**: your perception extends beyond the physical into the supernatural. You are never blind to the hidden world.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Supernatural investigators** - See evidence others miss
- **Spirit mediums** - Communicate with ghosts
- **Mystics** - Natural supernatural sensitivity
- **Occult specialists** - Understand what you see
- **Paranormal researchers** - Study the invisible

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle is low-supernatural (nothing to see)
- You prefer combat focus over investigation
- Storyteller doesn't use hidden supernatural elements
- You want offensive capabilities (Third Eye is perception-only)

### Key Strengths

- **See the invisible** - Ghosts, spirits, incorporeal entities
- **Aura reading** - Emotions, supernatural nature, lies
- **Magic detection** - See spells, rituals, enchantments
- **True sight** - Pierce illusions and disguises
- **Complete awareness** - Supernatural and mundane simultaneously

### Limitations

- **Perception only** - Seeing doesn't mean affecting
- **Information overload** - Constant supernatural input (high Desperation)
- **Conspicuous** - Others notice you seeing "nothing"
- **Sanity strain** - Witnessing horror constantly
- **Storyteller-dependent** - Only useful if supernatural is present

## All Perks

### Spirit Sight

**Strategy Notes:**

  (they saw killer's reflection)

**Strategy Notes:**

**Example:**
```

Aura Reading: You see their aura
- Color: Pale blue-white (undead, vampire)
- Emotional state: Anxiety, fear (they're scared)
- Lies: Aura flickers when they say "I wasn't there"

You: "Your aura tells me everything."

Insight roll to press advantage:
Manipulation 3 + Insight 4 + Desperation 3 (Aura Reading lie detection) = 10 dice

Third Eye activated (passive perks):

Spirit Sight: You see 7 ghosts throughout mansion
- 3 in foyer (family members, murdered)

- 1 in basement (chained, tortured)
- 1 outside (groundskeeper, watching)

There's a living person upstairs, terrified.

Don't trust the mirror - trapped spirit inside."
