# Library 📚

Knowledge is power. You have the knowledge.

Library represents a Hunter's access to books, archives, databases, and information resources. Whether you maintain a personal collection, have access to institutional archives, or possess rare occult texts, you can research anything given time and effort.

## Overview

### What is Library?

Library is an **Asset Edge** that grants access to comprehensive information resources for research, study, and knowledge acquisition. You have books, documents, databases, and archives covering history, occult lore, supernatural threats, and esoteric knowledge.

The Edge operates on **research capability**: given time, you can find information on almost any topic. Unlike Contacts (asking people) or Global Access (digital networks), Library is about **traditional research** through texts, documents, and accumulated knowledge.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Investigators** - Intelligence/Investigation focused
- **Innocents** - Learn through study and research
- **Occult specialists** - Supernatural knowledge seekers
- **Support characters** - Provide intel to combat teams
- **Strategic planners** - Knowledge-based preparation

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your character is uneducated or anti-intellectual
- Your chronicle is action-focused with no research time
- Storyteller doesn't enjoy research scenes
- You prefer street knowledge to book learning

### Key Strengths

- **Comprehensive knowledge** - Research any topic
- **Occult lore** - Supernatural threat information
- **Historical records** - Past events and patterns
- **Preparation advantage** - Know enemy weaknesses
- **Self-sufficient** - Don't need contacts or external help

### Limitations

- **Time-intensive** - Research takes hours to days
- **Requires Intelligence** - Low Int limits effectiveness
- **Stationary** - Must access library physically (usually)
- **Interpretation needed** - Books don't always have clear answers
- **Storyteller-dependent** - Information availability varies

## All Perks

### Comprehensive Collection

**What It Does:**
Your library covers an extremely wide range of topics with depth. You have resources on history, science, occult, mythology, supernatural creatures, and esoteric knowledge.

**Coverage Areas:**
- **History** - Local, national, world history
- **Occult** - Supernatural lore, magic, rituals
- **Mythology** - Cultural myths, legends, folklore
- **Bestiary** - Creature information (vampires, werewolves, ghosts, etc.)
- **Science** - Academic texts, research papers
- **Religion** - Religious texts, theology, comparative religion
- **Rare Texts** - Out-of-print, ancient, forbidden knowledge

**When To Use:**
- **Threat identification** - What is this creature?

- **Weakness discovery** - How do we kill it?

**Strategy Notes:**

**Example:**
```
Encountering strange creature - humanoid, pale, drinks blood
Research in Comprehensive Collection
Topic: Vampires
Find: Multiple texts on vampire lore across cultures
Learn: Weaknesses (sunlight, stakes, fire), powers (strength, mesmerism), habits (need blood, avoid running water)
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Library
/perks edge:Library perk:Comprehensive Collection
```

### Rapid Research

**What It Does:**
You can find information quickly, reducing research time from days to hours, or hours to minutes. Your organizational system, knowledge of your collection, and research skills accelerate the process.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Reduce research time significantly
- Standard research (hours) → Rapid research (30-60 minutes)
- Deep research (days) → Rapid research (few hours)
- Advantage on Investigation rolls for research

**When To Use:**
- **Time pressure** - Need info NOW
- **Mid-investigation** - Quick verification
- **Combat prep** - Research enemy before fight
- **Session constraints** - Don't have days in-game

**Strategy Notes:**
- Essential for playability (waiting days isn't fun)
- Pairs with Intelligence + Investigation
- Still narratively describe research process
- Storyteller may require rolls for complex topics

**Example:**
```
Just learned vampire elder's name: "Marcus Vane"
Need background before tonight's confrontation
Normal research: 2-3 days
Rapid Research: 2 hours
You find historical records, known aliases, property holdings, rumored weaknesses
Ready for tonight's fight
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Library perk:Rapid Research
```

### Ritual Knowledge

**What It Does:**
Your library contains information on occult rituals, magical practices, and supernatural ceremonies. You can research how rituals work, identify rituals in progress, and learn to counter or perform them.

**Applications:**
- **Identify rituals** - What is this ceremony?
- **Understand effects** - What will happen?
- **Find counters** - How do we stop it?
- **Learn rituals** - How do we perform it ourselves?
- **Historical context** - Who did this before?

**Types of Rituals:**
- **Summoning** - Calling entities
- **Binding** - Trapping supernatural beings
- **Warding** - Protection magic
- **Curse/Blessing** - Affecting fortune
- **Transformation** - Changing form/nature
- **Divination** - Scrying, prophecy

**When To Use:**
- **Supernatural investigation** - Ritual sites discovered
- **Enemy countering** - Stop their magic
- **Ally assistance** - Learn protective rituals
- **Threat prevention** - Identify and disrupt rituals

**Strategy Notes:**
- Enables magical elements in play
- Coordinate with Storyteller on ritual rules
- Knowledge ≠ ability (may need Occult skill to perform)
- Powerful but often dangerous

**Example:**
```
Cult performing ritual at old church
You research the symbols and chant structure
Ritual Knowledge reveals: Summoning ritual for demon
Duration: 3 nights, tonight is night 2
Counter: Destroy chalk circle, kill lead cultist, or complete competing binding ritual
You plan disruption for tonight
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Library perk:Ritual Knowledge
```

---

### Obscure Lore

**What It Does:**
Your library contains rare, forbidden, or lost knowledge that few others can access. Obscure texts, ancient languages, suppressed information, and dangerous knowledge unavailable elsewhere.

**Examples:**
- **Forbidden texts** - Banned or destroyed knowledge
- **Ancient languages** - Texts requiring translation
- **Secret histories** - Suppressed truths
- **Lost sciences** - Forgotten techniques
- **Elder lore** - Knowledge of ancient beings
- **Personal notes** - Previous Hunters' journals

**When To Use:**
- **Unique threats** - Standard resources fail
- **Deep mysteries** - Uncover hidden truths
- **Legendary enemies** - Research ancient foes
- **Forbidden knowledge** - Learn dangerous secrets

**Strategy Notes:**
- Most powerful Library perk
- Obscure Lore can reveal anything Storyteller allows
- May require additional rolls or costs (Willpower, Desperation)
- Dangerous knowledge has consequences

**Example:**
```
Fighting vampire claiming to be 2000 years old
Standard research: Nothing on anyone that old
Obscure Lore: Ancient Latin text mentions "Marcus of Rome"
Knowledge revealed: True name, ancient enemies, specific vulnerability (blessed Roman gladius)
Also revealed: Disturbing truths about your city's founding
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Library perk:Obscure Lore
```

### Cross-Reference

**What It Does:**
You excel at finding connections between disparate sources, identifying patterns across multiple texts, and synthesizing information from various fields to reach insights.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Combine information from multiple sources
- Find patterns others miss
- Connect seemingly unrelated facts
- Bonus successes on research rolls with margin

**When To Use:**
- **Complex investigations** - Multiple clues
- **Pattern identification** - Serial incidents
- **Conspiracy unraveling** - Connect the dots
- **Historical parallels** - "This happened before"

**Strategy Notes:**
- Multiplies effectiveness of Comprehensive Collection
- Best with high Intelligence (analyzing connections)
- Pairs with Investigation skill
- Can reveal hidden plots

**Example:**
```
Researching recent disappearances in city
Cross-Reference across:
- Local history books (similar disappearances 50 years ago)
- Occult texts (feeding patterns match vampire behavior)
- Census records (victims all lived near old mansion)
- Property records (mansion owned by "M. Vane" for 150 years, different first names)
Conclusion: Vampire elder, same entity across time, operating from mansion
```

### Using Library in Play

Library operates through research rolls:

1. **Identify research topic** - What do you want to know?
2. **Storyteller sets difficulty** - Based on obscurity
3. **Apply perks** - Rapid Research (time), Obscure Lore (availability)
4. **Roll Intelligence + Investigation or Occult**
5. **Receive information** - Based on successes

**Example:**
```
You: "I want to research this vampire's history - Marcus Vane"
Storyteller: "Okay, Intelligence + Investigation, Difficulty 3 (not common knowledge)"
You have Rapid Research (2 hours instead of 2 days)
/roll pool:9 difficulty:3 comment:Researching Marcus Vane
(Intelligence 5 + Investigation 4 = 9 dice)
Result: 6 successes, Margin 3
Storyteller provides detailed dossier based on margin
```
