# Safehouse 🏠

A place of safety. A place of power. A place that's yours.

Safehouse represents a Hunter's secure location - a haven, hideout, base of operations, or fortress. Whether it's an apartment, warehouse, bunker, or mansion, this is your sanctuary where you're safe, equipped, and in control.

---

## Overview

### What is Safehouse?

Safehouse is an **Asset Edge** that grants a secure, defensible location under your control. More than just a home, it's a fortified position with security measures, resources, and tactical advantages for you and your cell.

The Edge operates on **territorial control**: within your Safehouse, you have home advantage. Security systems alert you to threats, defenses protect you, and resources support your operations. It's where you're strongest.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Defenders** - Protect your territory
- **Cell leaders** - Base for team operations
- **Planners** - Need secure planning space
- **Injured Hunters** - Safe recovery location
- **Long-term campaigns** - Permanent base of operations

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle is nomadic (always traveling)
- You prefer mobility over fortification
- Storyteller doesn't want fixed locations
- You're a loner who won't share space

### Key Strengths

- **Security** - Alerts and defenses against threats
- **Resources** - Equipment, supplies, medical
- **Team base** - Cell gathering point
- **Recovery** - Safe healing location
- **Tactical advantage** - Home field advantage in fights

### Limitations

- **Fixed location** - Can be found and attacked
- **Maintenance required** - Costs money, time, attention
- **Vulnerable when absent** - Enemies can strike when you're away
- **Shared space** - Cell may have access (less privacy)
- **Storyteller target** - Makes you easier to threaten

## All Perks

### Fortified

**What It Does:**
Your Safehouse has security measures, reinforced structures, and defensive preparations. Intruders trigger alarms, face obstacles, and can be repelled.

**Security Features:**
- **Alarms** - Motion sensors, cameras, tripwires
- **Reinforced doors/windows** - Hard to breach
- **Safe room** - Secure inner sanctum
- **Escape routes** - Hidden exits

**Mechanical Effects:**

- Difficulty for enemies to breach increases

**When To Use:**

- **Final stand** - Fortified last stand

**Strategy Notes:**
- Essential for any Safehouse

**Example:**
```
Vampire coterie attacks your Safehouse
Fortified activates:

**Example:**
```
Urgent call: Ghoul nest discovered, immediate response needed
Head to Safehouse Armory:

Survive without hospital visit (which would raise questions)
```

- Using facilities: Advantage on relevant skill checks
- Security: Alerts and impediments for intruders

**Example:**
```
Storyteller: "The vampires tracked you. They're outside your Safehouse."
You: "I'm alerted by perimeter sensors (Fortified). How many?"
Storyteller: "Four vampires, approaching the door."
You: "I grab weapons from the Armory, take position behind fortified cover."
Storyteller: "They breach the outer door - difficulty increased by Fortified. Roll initiative."
You fight with home advantage: +2 dice for defending your Safehouse
```
