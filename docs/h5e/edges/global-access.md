# Global Access 🌐

Information is power. You have access to all of it.

Global Access represents connection to vast information networks beyond normal reach - classified databases, intelligence agencies, surveillance systems, corporate espionage networks, or occult information exchanges. You can access knowledge that others can't, instantly and from anywhere.

---

## Overview

### What is Global Access?

Global Access is an **Endowment Edge** that grants supernatural ability to access information from any source, anywhere, instantly. Whether through mystical divination, technological backdoors, intelligence agency clearance, or supernatural information brokers, you can retrieve knowledge that should be impossible to obtain.

The Edge operates through **information channeling**: you tap into networks beyond normal reach. The exact mechanism varies (magic scrying, hacker backdoors, psychic reading, intelligence contacts), but the result is consistent - you know things you shouldn't.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Investigators** - Information is your weapon
- **Intelligence operatives** - Spy/agency background
- **Hackers** - Technological information access
- **Occult researchers** - Mystical knowledge networks
- **Strategists** - Perfect information for planning

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle doesn't support super-intelligence
- You prefer physical action to information gathering
- Storyteller doesn't want players bypassing investigations
- Your character lacks the technological/mystical background

### Key Strengths

- **Instant information** - No research time required
- **Unlimited scope** - Access any database, any source
- **Remote access** - No need to be physically present
- **Impossible knowledge** - Classified, hidden, occult information
- **Strategic advantage** - Perfect intelligence for operations

### Limitations

- **Storyteller-gated** - GM controls what you learn
- **Information only** - Doesn't provide physical resources
- **Conspicuous** - Accessing impossible information raises questions
- **May attract attention** - Intelligence agencies notice breaches
- **Desperation-dependent** - Power scales with Desperation

## All Perks

### Database Access

**What It Does:**
Access any digital database, system, or network instantly, regardless of security or clearance level. Retrieve information as if you had legitimate access.

**What You Can Access:**
- **Government databases** - Criminal records, classified files, intelligence
- **Corporate systems** - Employee records, financial data, R&D
- **Medical records** - Patient histories, treatment records
- **Financial systems** - Bank accounts, transactions, holdings
- **Surveillance** - Camera feeds, monitoring systems
- **Communications** - Emails, messages, phone records

**When To Use:**
- **Background checks** - Investigate suspects instantly
- **Location finding** - Track targets via surveillance/digital footprint
- **Evidence gathering** - Access deleted files, hidden records
- **Financial investigation** - Follow money trails
- **Identity verification** - Confirm cover stories or detect lies

**Strategy Notes:**
- Foundation perk for Global Access
- No roll required for basic access
- Roll Intelligence + Technology for complex data mining
- More effective than mundane hacking (bypasses security supernaturally)

**Example:**
```
Need to find vampire's human identity
Database Access: Search government databases
You find: Social security records going back 40 years (same person, hasn't aged)
Property records: Owns 3 homes under different names
Financial: Offshore accounts with suspicious transfers
Surveillance: Never appears during daytime (cameras confirm)
Complete profile built in minutes
Intelligence advantage gained
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Global Access
/perks edge:Global Access perk:Database Access
```

### Omniscient Network

**What It Does:**
Tap into supernatural information network - ask one specific question per session and receive accurate answer from occult sources (spirits, psychic network, mystical library, etc.).

**Question Guidelines:**
- Must be specific (not "tell me everything about vampires")
- Must have a true answer (can't ask unknowable things)
- Answer comes from supernatural sources (not mundane databases)
- Storyteller determines detail level based on question

**Example Questions:**
- "Where is the vampire elder's haven?"
- "What ritual is the witch performing tonight?"
- "Who murdered John Smith using supernatural means?"
- "What is the demon's true name?"
- "How do I kill the unkillable monster?"

**When To Use:**
- **Investigation breakthroughs** - Answer critical mysteries
- **Tactical planning** - Learn enemy weaknesses
- **Ritual knowledge** - Discover occult procedures
- **Location finding** - Find hidden supernatural lairs
- **True name discovery** - Learn demon/spirit identities

**Strategy Notes:**
- Once per session (save for critical moments)
- Supernatural knowledge focus (Database Access handles mundane)
- Question phrasing matters (be specific)
- Storyteller's discretion on answer detail

**Example:**
```
Hunting demon cult, need to find their temple
Omniscient Network: "Where is the demon cult's primary temple in this city?"
Storyteller: "Your mind fills with visions - an abandoned subway station beneath 5th Street,
accessed through maintenance tunnel. You see red-painted ritual chamber with
13 candles. The demon's sigil marks the floor. Three cult guards patrol."
Perfect intelligence for raid planning
Once-per-session power used wisely
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Global Access perk:Omniscient Network
```

### Predictive Analysis

**What It Does:**
Analyze patterns to predict future events and behaviors. Make an Intelligence + Investigation roll; successes reveal likely future developments.

**What You Can Predict:**
- **Enemy actions** - Where vampire will strike next
- **Pattern completion** - Serial killer's next target
- **Behavior forecasting** - How target will react to stimulus
- **Tactical outcomes** - Likely combat results
- **Investigation progress** - Where clues will lead

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Action: Spend 10 minutes analyzing available data
- Roll: Intelligence + Investigation + Desperation
- Difficulty: 2 (routine patterns) to 5 (chaotic situations)
- Successes: Each success = one accurate prediction detail

**When To Use:**
- **Ambush preparation** - Predict enemy arrival
- **Protection** - Predict where victim will be attacked
- **Investigation** - Predict where evidence will appear
- **Tactical planning** - Predict enemy strategy
- **Resource allocation** - Predict where you'll be needed

**Strategy Notes:**
- Requires data to analyze (Database Access synergy)
- Better with high Intelligence + Investigation
- Desperation adds bonus (supernatural insight)
- Not perfect (chaos can disrupt patterns)

**Example:**
```
Serial killer targeting brunette women, 5 victims so far
Predictive Analysis: Analyze pattern
Roll: Intelligence 4 + Investigation 5 + Desperation 3 = 12 dice
/roll pool:12 difficulty:3 comment:Predicting next victim
Result: 6 successes
Predictions revealed:
- Next victim: Brunette, late 20s, lives alone
- Location: Downtown apartment district, east side
- Timing: Friday night, between 10pm-midnight
- Method: Same as previous (break-in, blitz attack)
- Motive pattern: Victims all resemble killer's ex-wife
- Weak point: Killer enters via fire escape (predictable entry)
Set ambush with perfect intelligence
```

**Herald Commands:**

Success: You warn team before vampire drops from ceiling
Perfect intelligence wins fights
```

Information Broker: Sell location to vampire hunter organization
Trade: Location intel for Resources 3 (temporary), plus organization owes favor
Resources 3 = $5,000 budget for equipment

Cross-reference: Utility records show massive power draw (refrigeration for blood?)
Predictive Analysis: Roll Intelligence 5 + Investigation 5 + Desperation 2 = 12 dice
/roll pool:12 difficulty:2 comment:Analyzing vampire haven location
