# Inspire 💪

Lead them. Strengthen them. Make them unstoppable.

Inspire represents a Hunter's ability to bolster, motivate, and empower allies through supernatural charisma and leadership. Your presence makes others braver, stronger, and more capable. You're the force multiplier.

---

## Overview

### What is Inspire?

Inspire is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants supernatural leadership and ally enhancement. When you invoke Inspire, your allies fight harder, resist fear, and push beyond their limits. Your words and presence supernaturally empower those who fight alongside you.

The Edge operates through **supernatural charisma**: you channel supernatural energy through leadership, making your allies superhuman when they need it most. This isn't just motivation - it's mystical empowerment.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Leaders** - Cell commanders
- **Support characters** - Make allies stronger
- **Defenders** - Protect through empowerment
- **Charismatic builds** - High Charisma/Leadership
- **Team players** - Enhance group effectiveness

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You're a solo Hunter (no allies to inspire)
- You have low Charisma
- You prefer selfish tactics
- Your group is small (1-2 people)

### Key Strengths

- **Force multiplier** - Makes entire team stronger
- **Team survival** - Buff ally defenses and rolls
- **Morale** - Resist fear and despair effects
- **Leadership** - Command effectively in chaos
- **Synergy** - Best in groups

### Limitations

- **Requires allies** - Useless if solo
- **Action economy** - Buffing allies costs your actions
- **Range limited** - Must be near allies
- **Desperation cost** - Using Inspire increases Desperation
- **Indirect power** - You're strong through others
