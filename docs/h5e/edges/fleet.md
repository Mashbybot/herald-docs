# Fleet 🏃

Move faster. Strike harder. Never caught.

Fleet represents supernatural speed, enhanced reflexes, and exceptional agility. You move like the wind, react before others can think, and outmaneuver any opponent. Speed is your weapon.

## Overview

### What is Fleet?

Fleet is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants superhuman speed and agility. You run faster than humanly possible, react with lightning reflexes, and perform acrobatic feats that defy physics. This isn't training - it's supernatural enhancement.

The Edge operates through **supernatural enhancement**: when you invoke Fleet, you become impossibly fast. Time seems to slow for you as you blur past enemies, dodge bullets, and cover impossible distances in seconds.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Combat specialists** - Mobile hit-and-run tactics
- **Scouts** - Fast reconnaissance
- **Defenders** - Rapid response to threats
- **Escape artists** - Never trapped
- **Pursuit specialists** - Chase down any target

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle is confined/indoor focused (limited room to run)
- You prefer stationary tactics
- You don't have Athletics skill
- Your Dexterity is low (Fleet works best with high Dex)

### Key Strengths

- **Combat mobility** - Superior positioning in fights
- **Escape capability** - Run from anything
- **Pursuit** - Chase down fleeing enemies
- **Initiative advantage** - Act first consistently
- **Acrobatic feats** - Impossible maneuvers

### Limitations

- **Requires space** - Limited in tight confines
- **Desperation cost** - Using Fleet increases Desperation
- **Obvious supernatural** - Hard to hide this ability
- **Stamina drain** - Can't maintain forever
- **May separate from team** - Too fast for allies

Fleet operates through Desperation-fueled enhancement:

2. **Add Desperation** - Bonuses = your Desperation rating
3. **Describe effect** - Blur, speed trails, impossible movements
4. **Resolve action** - Roll with bonuses
5. **Desperation consequences** - Using Fleet may increase Desperation

**Example:**
```
Storyteller: "Three vampires surround you. Roll initiative."
You: "I invoke Fleet - Lightning Reflexes. My initiative is Wits 4 + Dex 5 + Desperation 3 = 12 dice"
/roll pool:12 difficulty:0 comment:Fleet-enhanced initiative
Result: 7 successes (vampires get 3, 4, 4)
You act first, targeting the lead vampire before they can attack
```
