# Senses 👁️

See everything. Hear everything. Know everything.

Senses represents supernatural enhancement of perception - sight, hearing, smell, and intuition all heightened beyond human limits. Nothing escapes your notice. You see in darkness, hear whispers across rooms, and sense danger before it strikes.

---

## Overview

### What is Senses?

Senses is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants superhuman perception across all sensory modalities. When you invoke Senses, you perceive details impossible for normal humans - see in total darkness, hear heartbeats, smell fear, and sense supernatural presences.

The Edge operates through **supernatural perception**: your senses transcend human limits. You perceive reality more completely than others, noticing details, threats, and opportunities that are invisible to normal people.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Scouts** - Reconnaissance and early warning
- **Investigators** - Notice all clues
- **Defenders** - Detect threats early
- **Hunters** - Track any prey
- **High Wits builds** - Maximize perception

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You have low Awareness skill
- Your chronicle doesn't reward perception
- You prefer direct action over observation
- Sensory overload would bother you thematically

### Key Strengths

- **Perfect perception** - Notice everything
- **Threat detection** - Never surprised
- **Investigation** - Find all clues
- **Tracking** - Follow any trail
- **Supernatural sight** - See what others can't

### Limitations

- **Information overload** - Too much input can overwhelm
- **Doesn't grant action** - See threats but still must respond
- **Sensory attacks** - Heightened senses = vulnerability to loud/bright attacks
- **Requires interpretation** - See clues but must understand them
- **Desperation cost** - Using Senses increases Desperation
