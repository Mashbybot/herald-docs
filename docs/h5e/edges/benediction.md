# Benediction 🙏

Divine power flows through you. Blessings heal, faith protects, prayer destroys evil.

Benediction represents a Hunter's connection to divine forces that grant supernatural protection and healing. Whether through prayer, faith, or divine favor, you channel celestial power to shield allies, heal wounds, and smite the wicked.

---

## Overview

### What is Benediction?

Benediction is an **Endowment Edge** that grants divine supernatural abilities focused on protection, healing, and blessing. You are touched by higher powers - your faith is rewarded with genuine miracles that manifest as protective auras, healing light, and divine judgment.

The Edge operates through **divine channeling**: you are a conduit for celestial power. Through prayer, faith, or ritual, you invoke blessings that protect the righteous and harm the profane.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Faithful Hunters** - Priests, clerics, believers
- **Healers** - Medical/support role
- **Defenders** - Protect through divine power
- **Redeemers** - Save souls with blessings
- **Holy warriors** - Faith and combat combined

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your character lacks faith/spirituality
- Your chronicle doesn't support divine powers
- You prefer offensive/combat focus (Benediction is support-heavy)
- Storyteller doesn't want overt divine intervention

### Key Strengths

- **Healing** - Restore Health supernaturally
- **Protection** - Divine shields and blessings
- **Support** - Buff allies with celestial power
- **Purification** - Cleanse corruption and curses
- **Morale** - Inspire through visible miracles

### Limitations

- **Faith required** - Narratively tied to belief
- **Defensive focus** - Limited offensive capabilities
- **Willpower intensive** - Most powers cost Willpower
- **Divine judgment** - Powers may fail if used unworthily
- **Obvious supernatural** - Hard to hide divine miracles
