# Sense Danger ⚠️

Danger never surprises you. Threats reveal themselves before they strike.

Sense Danger represents supernatural awareness of threats, hazards, and hostile intent. Whether through precognition, divine warning, supernatural intuition, or mystical sensitivity, you perceive danger before it manifests - giving you critical seconds to react, defend, or escape.

---

## Overview

### What is Sense Danger?

Sense Danger is an **Endowment Edge** that grants preternatural awareness of threats and hazards. You receive warnings - mental flashes, divine whispers, gut feelings, or mystical visions - when danger approaches, allowing you to react before others even perceive the threat.

The Edge operates through **threat precognition**: you sense hostile intent, imminent harm, and dangerous situations moments before they occur. This supernatural early warning system keeps you and your allies alive.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Bodyguards** - Protect others from unseen threats
- **Point scouts** - Lead team safely through danger
- **Paranoid survivors** - Never caught off-guard
- **Mystics** - Supernatural sensitivity to danger
- **Defenders** - React before threats materialize

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You prefer reactive play to proactive defense
- Your Storyteller doesn't use ambushes/traps
- You want offensive capabilities (Sense Danger is defensive)
- Your chronicle is low-danger/investigation-focused

### Key Strengths

- **Cannot be surprised** - Always detect ambushes
- **Trap detection** - Sense hazards before triggering
- **Ally protection** - Warn others of danger
- **Threat prioritization** - Identify greatest dangers
- **Survival enhancement** - Avoid deadly situations

### Limitations

- **Defensive only** - Doesn't help you fight threats
- **Warning only** - Tells you danger exists, not always specifics
- **Requires reaction** - Knowing danger ≠ avoiding it automatically
- **Storyteller-dependent** - GM determines what constitutes "danger"
- **False positives** - High-Desperation paranoia

## All Perks

### Danger Sense

**What It Does:**
You cannot be surprised. Whenever danger threatens you or nearby allies, you receive immediate warning - allowing you to act in surprise rounds and alert others.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Cannot be ambushed or surprised
- Always act in surprise rounds
- Awareness rolls to detect threats: Add Desperation as bonus dice
- Can warn allies (they avoid surprise if you succeed)

**When To Use:**
- **Ambush scenarios** - Detect hidden attackers
- **Surprise rounds** - Act when others can't
- **Sentry duty** - Perfect guard (never caught unaware)
- **Protecting allies** - Warning prevents team surprises

**Strategy Notes:**
- Foundation perk for Sense Danger Edge
- Always active (no action/cost required)
- Scales with Desperation (higher = more sensitive)
- Team protective (your warning helps everyone)

**Example:**
```
Vampires hiding in warehouse rafters, ambush planned
Normal party: Surprised, vampires attack first
You (Danger Sense): Immediate warning
- Gut clenches, hair stands on end
- Vision flashes: vampires above
- You shout warning to team

Roll Awareness to alert team:
Wits 3 + Awareness 4 + Desperation 3 (Danger Sense) = 10 dice
/roll pool:10 difficulty:2 comment:Warning team of vampire ambush
Result: 6 successes - team alerted before vampires drop
No surprise round, initiative rolled normally
Ambush prevented, lives saved
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Sense Danger
/perks edge:Sense Danger perk:Danger Sense
```

### Threat Assessment

**What It Does:**
Instantly identify the greatest threat in any situation. You know which enemy is most dangerous, which path is most hazardous, which choice is most risky.

**What You Assess:**
- **Combat threats** - Identify most dangerous enemy
- **Environmental hazards** - Which route is safest
- **Situational risks** - Which choice carries most danger
- **Hidden threats** - Detect concealed dangers
- **Priority targeting** - Know what to neutralize first

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Action: Assess situation (reflexive, no action cost)
- Automatic knowledge: Storyteller identifies greatest threat
- Combat: Know most dangerous enemy
- Investigation: Know most dangerous path/choice

**When To Use:**
- **Combat initiation** - Target biggest threat first
- **Dungeon exploration** - Choose safest path
- **Decision points** - Identify riskiest choice
- **Threat prioritization** - Optimize team targeting

**Strategy Notes:**
- Reflexive (doesn't cost action)
- Always active (passive threat ranking)
- Tactical advantage (focus fire on real threats)
- Synergizes with combat skills (know what to shoot)

**Example:**
```
Entering vampire haven: 5 vampires visible
Threat Assessment: Automatic ranking
Storyteller reveals:
- Vampire #3 is elder (ancient, immensely powerful) - GREATEST THREAT
- Vampires #1, #2 are fledglings (weak)
- Vampire #4 is sorcerer (dangerous magic)
- Vampire #5 is ghoul (human servant, not supernatural)

Combat priority: Focus elder first (biggest threat)
Team coordination: "Take down the one in the center - he's the ancient!"
Tactical advantage through supernatural threat ranking
Kill most dangerous enemy first
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Sense Danger perk:Threat Assessment
```

---

### Precognition

**What It Does:**
Receive brief visions of immediate future (next few seconds to minutes). See attacks before they land, traps before they trigger, disasters before they strike.

**Vision Content:**
- **Combat precognition** - See attacks 1-2 seconds before they occur
- **Trap warning** - Vision of trap triggering before you step
- **Disaster foresight** - Flash of building collapse, explosion, etc.
- **Assassination prevention** - See sniper aiming before shot
- **Route optimization** - See which path leads to danger

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Add Desperation to Defense rolls (see attacks coming)
- Automatically detect traps (vision shows trigger)
- Reroll failed Defense once per scene (precog lets you adjust)
- Storyteller provides brief visions of immediate dangers

**When To Use:**
- **Combat defense** - Dodge attacks supernaturally well
- **Trap navigation** - See triggers before stepping
- **Assassination defense** - Detect snipers/ambushes
- **Disaster avoidance** - Escape before catastrophe

**Strategy Notes:**
- Defensive combat boost (better Defense)
- Synergizes with high Dexterity (precog + agility = unhittable)
- Reroll mechanic = clutch saves
- Scene-long benefit (always active in dangerous situations)

**Example:**
```
Vampire elder attacks with superhuman speed
Precognition: You see the strike 1 second before it occurs
- Vision: Vampire's claw raking across your throat
- Reality: You dodge before it even moves

Defense roll:
Dex 4 + Athletics 3 + Desperation 4 (Precognition) = 11 dice
/roll pool:11 difficulty:3 comment:Precognitive dodge
Result: 5 successes - vampire misses despite speed
You're already moving before it strikes
Precognition makes you nearly untouchable

Later in same combat:
Failed Defense (vampire connects)
Precognition: Reroll Defense once per scene
Second roll: Success, you twist away at last instant
Clutch save through future sight
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Sense Danger perk:Precognition
```

### Danger to Others

**What It Does:**
Extend your Danger Sense to protect allies. You sense threats to your team as clearly as threats to yourself - warning them before danger strikes.

**Extended Sensing:**
- Sense danger to any ally you can see
- Receive warnings for threats targeting team
- Can warn specific ally of specific threat
- Team benefits from your precognition

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Allies within sight benefit from your Danger Sense (cannot be surprised)
- You can warn specific ally: they add your Desperation to their Defense
- Once per scene: Take action for endangered ally (move/defend/intervene)
- Team-wide threat awareness

**When To Use:**
- **Team protection** - Extend Danger Sense to everyone
- **Bodyguard missions** - Protect VIP with supernatural awareness
- **Covering fire** - Warn allies under attack
- **Coordinated defense** - Entire team benefits from precognition

**Strategy Notes:**
- Team force multiplier (everyone benefits)
- Essential for Defender/bodyguard concepts
- Synergizes with Martyr Edge (sense danger + tank for ally)
- Makes entire team harder to ambush/surprise

**Example:**
```
Team assaulting vampire haven
Danger to Others: You sense threats to entire team
- Vampire #1 targeting Scout: You shout "Left side!"
  Scout adds your Desperation 3 to Defense
- Vampire #2 about to ambush Medic from behind
  You (once per scene): Move to intercept before vampire strikes
- Trap pressure plate ahead of Tank
  Vision shows trap, you warn: "Stop! Trap at your 10 o'clock!"

Entire team operates with supernatural threat awareness
Your precognition protects everyone
Team survives through your warnings
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Sense Danger perk:Danger to Others
```

---

### Avoid Fate

**What It Does:**
Once per session, receive critical warning that allows you to completely avoid catastrophic danger. You see disastrous future and change course to prevent it.

**Fate Avoidance:**
- **Vision trigger:** Sense impending disaster (death, capture, mission failure)
- **Information:** See exactly what will happen if you continue current course
- **Choice:** Change your actions to avoid fate
- **Outcome:** Disaster prevented through foreknowledge

**What You Can Avoid:**
- **Death** - Your own or ally's
- **Mission failure** - See operation going wrong
- **Catastrophic error** - Realize mistake before making it
- **Betrayal** - Sense trap before walking into it
- **Doom** - Any disastrous outcome

**When To Use:**
- **Life-or-death moments** - See your own death coming
- **Critical decisions** - Vision shows which choice leads to disaster
- **Mission planning** - Foresee operation failure
- **Trust decisions** - Sense betrayal before it occurs
- **Ultimate save** - Prevent worst outcome

**Strategy Notes:**
- Once per session (save for truly critical moments)
- Storyteller collaboration (GM describes vision)
- Narrative weight (you're changing fate)
- Cannot save you from consequences of ignoring vision

**Example:**
```
Planning to raid vampire haven at dawn
Avoid Fate triggers: Catastrophic vision
Vision content:
- You breach the haven, vampires cornered
- Elder reveals hidden power: daylight immunity (unique)
- Elder slaughters entire team in sunlight
- Mission ends in total party kill

Present: You stop team before raid
"We can't go in. I saw it - the elder can survive sunlight.
If we breach now, we all die."
Team changes strategy: investigate elder's unique power first
Disaster averted through precognition
Once-per-session power used perfectly
```

**Herald Commands:**
