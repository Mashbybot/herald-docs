---

## Overview

### What is Scrounger?

Scrounger is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants supernatural luck and resourcefulness. When you need something - equipment, information, shelter - you find it through impossible coincidences and supernatural providence.

The Edge operates through **supernatural providence**: the universe provides what you need when you need it. Luck, intuition, and impossible coincidences conspire to supply you with resources.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Survivors** - Find resources in any situation
- **Improvisers** - MacGyver-style problem solving
- **Poor Hunters** - No money, all luck
- **Innocents** - Stumble into solutions
- **Support characters** - Supply the team

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You have wealth/resources already (Arsenal, Status)
- You prefer planned approaches
- Storyteller doesn't like coincidence mechanics
- You want reliable/predictable resources

### Key Strengths

- **Always equipped** - Find what you need
- **Improvisation** - Create solutions from junk
- **Survival** - Never without basics
- **Flexibility** - Adapt to any situation
- **Self-sufficient** - Don't need money/connections

### Limitations

- **Unpredictable** - What you find varies
- **Storyteller-dependent** - GM determines availability
- **Improvised quality** - Items may be suboptimal
- **No control** - Find what's there, not what you want exactly
- **Requires scavenging** - Must search/look
