# Contacts 📱

You know people. People who know things. People who owe you favors.

Contacts represents a Hunter's network of allies, informants, associates, and connections across society. From street-level snitches to corporate executives, you have people you can call when you need information or assistance.

---

## Overview

### What is Contacts?

Contacts is an **Asset Edge** that grants access to a wide network of human (and sometimes supernatural) allies and informants. You have built relationships, earned favors, and cultivated connections that provide information, assistance, and resources.

The Edge operates through **social capital**: you call in favors, exchange information, and leverage relationships to accomplish goals. Unlike Arsenal (weapons) or Library (books), Contacts is about **people** - and people are complicated, useful, and sometimes unreliable.

###

 Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Defenders** - Community protectors with local networks
- **Investigators** - Detectives who need information sources
- **Social characters** - Charisma/Manipulation builds
- **Urban Hunters** - City-based operations
- **Infiltrators** - Those who need access and intel

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle is isolated (rural, wilderness, other dimensions)
- You prefer self-sufficiency over social networks
- Storyteller doesn't enjoy NPC role play
- Your character concept is a loner

### Key Strengths

- **Information access** - Learn anything with the right contact
- **Social support** - People who can help you
- **Versatility** - Contacts in many fields
- **Story hooks** - NPCs create plotlines
- **Favor economy** - Trade assistance for assistance

### Limitations

- **Requires roleplay** - Must interact with NPCs
- **Not always reliable** - Contacts can fail, betray, or be unavailable
- **Takes time** - Making calls, meeting contacts, building trust
- **Storyteller-dependent** - Effectiveness varies by GM
- **Social investment** - Must maintain relationships

## All Perks

### Word on the Street

**What It Does:**
You can quickly gather rumors, news, and street-level intelligence. Your network of low-level informants keeps you informed about local events, threats, and opportunities.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Reduce time to gather basic information
- Automatic passive information flow
- Advantage on Streetwise rolls
- Know about local incidents within hours

**When To Use:**
- **Investigation starts** - Get initial leads
- **Tracking movements** - Where did the vampire go?
- **Local rumors** - What's happening in the neighborhood?
- **Threat detection** - Early warning of supernatural activity

**Strategy Notes:**
- Best for urban settings
- Pairs with Streetwise skill
- Provides session starts and hooks
- Storyteller feeds you information

**Example:**
```
Vampire coterie moves into your territory
Word on the Street activates automatically
Storyteller: "Your street contacts mention disappearances near the docks, strange pale figures at night"
You get the lead without even asking
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Contacts
/perks edge:Contacts perk:Word on the Street

### Ask a Favor

**What It Does:**
Call in a favor from a specific contact for assistance, resources, or action. The contact helps you based on your relationship and their capabilities.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Identify contact and favor needed
- Roll social skill (usually Manipulation + Persuasion or Streetwise)
- Success = they help
- Margin determines extent of help

**Types of Favors:**
- **Information** - Tell me about this person/place/thing
- **Access** - Get me into this building/event/organization
- **Resources** - Provide money, equipment, shelter
- **Action** - Do this thing for me
- **Cover** - Provide alibi, false records, misdirection

**When To Use:**

- **Investigation** - Access restricted information
- **Resources** - Borrow money, equipment
- **Cover stories** - Maintain secret identity

**Strategy Notes:**
- Build relationships in-game first
- Don't abuse favors (contacts get tired)
- Offer favors in return (build credit)
- Coordinate with Storyteller on contact capabilities

**Example:**
```
You need police records on a suspect
Contact: Detective friend on the force
Favor: "Pull the file for me, off the books"
Roll: Manipulation 3 + Persuasion 3 = 6 dice, Difficulty 2
Success: They provide the file
Margin 3: They include extra intel (associates, known locations)
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Contacts perk:Ask a Favor
```

**What It Does:**
You have a contact with specific expertise in a field who can provide expert consultation, analysis, or assistance in their domain.

**Specialist Fields:**

**Example:**
```
Specialist: Dr. Sarah Chen, Medical Examiner
Need: Autopsy results on vampire victim
Contact her for unofficial analysis
She identifies unusual blood patterns, missing organs
Provides expert medical perspective on supernatural death
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Contacts perk:Specialist
```

### Deep Background

**What It Does:**
Your contacts can compile detailed dossiers on individuals, including personal history, associations, secrets, and vulnerabilities.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Identify target for background check
- Contacts research and compile information
- Takes time (hours to days)
- Result: Comprehensive dossier

**Dossier Contains:**
- **Personal Info** - Name, address, employment, family
- **History** - Education, career, major life events
- **Associates** - Friends, enemies, allies, contacts
- **Financial** - Income, debts, assets
- **Secrets** - Affairs, crimes, hidden identities
- **Vulnerabilities** - Weaknesses, leverage points

**When To Use:**
- **Social manipulation** - Know your target
- **Threat assessment** - Understand the enemy
- **Recruitment** - Vet potential allies
- **Blackmail** - Find leverage

**Strategy Notes:**
- Time-intensive (plan ahead)
- Some targets harder to research (supernatural, hidden)
- Information quality varies
- Use to prep for social encounters

**Example:**
```
Target: Marcus Vane, suspected vampire elder
Request Deep Background through contacts
Time: 3 days
Result: Dossier reveals real name (from 1800s), known aliases, property holdings, mortal family descendants (leverage), known associates (other vampires), rumored weaknesses
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Contacts perk:Deep Background
```

### Safe Place

**What It Does:**
One of your contacts can provide a secure location when you need to lay low, hide from threats, or operate covertly.

**Types of Safe Places:**

- **Warehouse** - Storage and operation base
- **Hotel room** - Anonymous lodging
- **Rural safehouse** - Remote hideout
- **Corporate office** - Legitimate cover

**When To Use:**
- **Laying low** - Heat is on, need to disappear
- **Operations base** - Planning and preparation
- **Injured/recovering** - Safe healing location
- **Witness protection** - Hide important NPCs
- **Emergency shelter** - Cell needs sanctuary

**Strategy Notes:**
- Different from Safehouse Edge (this is one contact's place, not permanent)
- Multiple Contacts = multiple safe places
- Temporary solution
- Don't abuse (wear out welcome)

**Example:**
```
Vampire coterie hunting you after killing one of theirs
Need to disappear for a week
Contact: Old army buddy with rural cabin
Safe Place: Remote cabin, 3 hours from city
You lay low, heal up, plan counter-attack
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Contacts perk:Safe Place
