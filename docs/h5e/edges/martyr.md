# Martyr ❤️

Sacrifice. Protect. Endure. They live because you suffer.

Martyr represents a Hunter's ability to take damage meant for others, absorb punishment supernaturally, and turn sacrifice into power. You're the shield that never breaks, the wall that protects your allies.

---

## Overview

### What is Martyr?

Martyr is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants supernatural durability and the ability to redirect harm from allies to yourself. When you invoke Martyr, you become impossibly resilient, absorbing damage that would kill others and continuing to fight.

The Edge operates through **sacrificial power**: your willingness to suffer for others grants supernatural endurance. Pain empowers you, wounds strengthen your resolve, and your sacrifice inspires allies.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Defenders** - Ultimate protector
- **Tanks** - Absorb damage for team
- **Support characters** - Keep allies alive
- **High Stamina builds** - Survive the punishment
- **Selfless concepts** - Sacrifice-driven characters

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You're a solo Hunter (no allies to protect)
- You have low Health/Stamina
- You prefer avoiding damage
- You're a primary damage dealer

### Key Strengths

- **Ally protection** - Redirect damage from allies
- **Supernatural durability** - Absorb impossible amounts of damage
- **Sacrifice power** - Pain makes you stronger
- **Team survival** - Keep everyone alive
- **Moral authority** - Inspire through self-sacrifice

### Limitations

- **You take the damage** - Will be wounded frequently
- **Requires healing** - Need support after absorbing hits
- **Action economy** - Protecting costs actions
- **Range limited** - Must be near allies
- **Requires allies** - Useless if solo

## All Perks

### Intercept

**What It Does:**
Instantly move to intercept an attack targeting an ally within range, taking the hit instead of them.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Reaction: Triggered when ally is attacked
- Range: Sprint distance (or line of sight)
- Effect: You take the damage instead
- No roll needed (automatic if declared)

**When To Use:**
- **Ally would die** - Fatal blow coming
- **Protect key ally** - Save the healer/leader
- **Tactical sacrifice** - You can survive it better
- **Dramatic moments** - Heroic protection

**Strategy Notes:**
- Requires high Health pool
- Position near vulnerable allies
- Have healing available
- Pairs with Inspire (your sacrifice inspires others)

**Example:**
```
Vampire elder attacks the healer (your ally)
Attack would deal 6 lethal damage (healer has 4 Health - fatal)
Intercept: You dive in front, taking the hit
You take 6 lethal (you have 7 Health - survive)
Healer lives, can heal you next turn
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Martyr
/perks edge:Martyr perk:Intercept
```

### Resilience

**What It Does:**
Supernaturally increase your Health pool. Add your Desperation rating to your maximum Health.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Health = Stamina + 3 + Desperation
- Dynamic (changes with Desperation)
- Absorb more damage before incapacitation

**When To Use:**
- **Always active** - Passive benefit
- **High Desperation** - Maximum Health boost
- **Tank role** - Absorb team damage
- **Sustained combat** - Survive longer fights

**Strategy Notes:**
- More effective with high Desperation
- Pairs with high Stamina (base Health)
- Essential for tank builds
- Allows risky plays

**Example:**
```
Base: Stamina 4 + 3 = 7 Health
Resilience + Desperation 4: 7 + 4 = 11 Health
You can absorb significantly more damage
Tank for team effectively
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Martyr perk:Resilience
```

---

### Pain is Power

**What It Does:**
Add bonus dice equal to your current damage to attack rolls. More wounded = more powerful.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Count current damage (lethal + superficial)
- Add that number as bonus dice to attacks
- More hurt = more deadly

**When To Use:**
- **After taking damage** - Convert pain to offense
- **Desperate situation** - Near death = maximum power
- **Revenge strikes** - Hit back hard
- **Final stand** - Last attack with full power

**Strategy Notes:**
- High-risk, high-reward
- Encourages tanking damage
- Dramatic power escalation
- Pairs with Intercept (take hits, hit back harder)

**Example:**
```
You've taken 5 damage (7 Health total)
Pain is Power: +5 dice to attacks
Normal attack: Dex 3 + Firearms 4 = 7 dice
Powered attack: 7 + 5 = 12 dice
Devastating strike fueled by pain
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Martyr perk:Pain is Power
```

---

### Last Stand

**What It Does:**
When reduced to 1 Health, gain supernatural surge. All actions gain massive bonuses for one turn before you collapse.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Trigger: Reduced to 1 Health
- Effect: +5 dice to all actions for one turn
- After: Collapse unconscious
- Once per scene

**When To Use:**
- **Death blow** - One final strike
- **Protect allies** - Last act of protection
- **Desperate moment** - Turn the tide before falling
- **Dramatic sacrifice** - Heroic final stand

**Strategy Notes:**
- Extremely dramatic
- Plan final action carefully
- Best used to eliminate major threat
- Have ally ready to stabilize/heal you

**Example:**
```
Combat vs vampire elder, you're at 1 Health
Last Stand triggers: +5 dice to all actions this turn
Attack: (Dex 4 + Firearms 4 + 5) = 13 dice
Final desperate shot destroys vampire
You collapse unconscious
Allies stabilize you after victory
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Martyr perk:Last Stand
```

---

### Indomitable

**What It Does:**
Automatically stabilize when incapacitated. You never die from injuries - you always stabilize and can be saved.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- No death from damage
- Automatic stabilization
- Allies can always save you
- Requires medical attention to recover

**When To Use:**
- **Always active** - Passive safety net
- **Tank role** - Take extreme risks
- **Protect allies** - You can afford to fall
- **Dramatic recoveries** - Return from "death"

**Strategy Notes:**
- Ultimate safety net for tanks
- Enables extreme sacrifice plays
- Still requires healing to recover
- Can be captured if incapacitated

**Example:**
```
Taking massive damage, Health reaches 0
Normal: Death or dying
Indomitable: Automatically stabilize
Unconscious but alive
Allies can heal you post-combat
You always survive if allies can reach you
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Martyr perk:Indomitable
```
