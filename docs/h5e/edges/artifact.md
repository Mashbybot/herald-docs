# Artifact 🗡️

Wield power beyond mortal reach. Ancient relics answer your call.

Artifact represents possession of a supernatural object with mystical power. Whether an enchanted weapon, holy relic, cursed tool, or ancient talisman, your artifact is a channel for supernatural forces that normal Hunters can only dream of wielding.

---

## Overview

### What is Artifact?

Artifact is an **Endowment Edge** that grants you a supernatural object imbued with mystical power. Unlike Arsenal (which provides superior mundane weapons), your artifact has genuine supernatural properties - it channels forces beyond the natural world.

The Edge operates through **mystical channeling**: the artifact serves as a conduit for supernatural power. It may be blessed, cursed, enchanted, or simply ancient beyond reckoning, but it responds to your will and enhances your Hunt.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Relic hunters** - Those who seek mystical objects
- **Holy warriors** - Wielders of blessed weapons
- **Occult specialists** - Understanding artifact mechanics
- **Tradition keepers** - Inherited family artifacts
- **Combat specialists** - Enhanced weapons for fighting

**Consider Carefully If:**
- You prefer mundane approaches
- Your chronicle doesn't include magic items
- You want multiple equipment options (artifacts are singular)
- Storyteller doesn't want supernatural items

### Key Strengths

- **Supernatural power** - Genuine mystical abilities
- **Effective vs supernatural** - Harm creatures immune to mundane attacks
- **Unique capabilities** - Powers unavailable through other means
- **Legendary quality** - Never breaks, never fails
- **Growth potential** - Artifact strengthens with use

### Limitations

- **Single object** - One artifact only
- **Obvious supernatural** - Hard to conceal mystical nature
- **Requires attunement** - Must bond with artifact
- **Plot significance** - Enemies may seek to steal it
- **Storyteller-dependent** - GM defines exact capabilities

## All Perks

### Enchanted Weapon

**What It Does:**
Your artifact is a weapon that deals aggravated damage to supernatural creatures. Vampires, werewolves, demons, and spirits can be harmed by your mystical blade/gun/implement.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Weapon deals aggravated damage to supernatural entities
- Bypasses supernatural defenses (armor, hardened skin, etc.)
- Never breaks or dulls
- Bonded to you (only you can wield effectively)

**When To Use:**
- **Vampire combat** - Cut through undead flesh
- **Demon fighting** - Harm incorporeal entities
- **Spirit combat** - Strike the intangible
- **Supernatural armor** - Pierce defenses mundane weapons can't touch

**Strategy Notes:**
- Foundation perk for Artifact Edge
- Makes you primary supernatural combatant
- Essential for fighting high-tier enemies
- Pairs with combat skills (Melee/Firearms)

**Example:**
```
Fighting ancient vampire with supernatural resilience
Normal weapons: Barely scratch it
Enchanted Weapon: Your blessed blade cuts deep
Attack: Melee 4 + Str 3 = 7 dice
/roll pool:7 difficulty:2 comment:Enchanted blade vs vampire
Result: 5 successes, 3 aggravated damage
Vampire takes real wounds despite supernatural toughness
Artifact's mystical nature bypasses its defenses
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Artifact
/perks edge:Artifact perk:Enchanted Weapon
```

### Protective Aura

**What It Does:**
The artifact shields you from supernatural harm. Add your Desperation rating as bonus armor against supernatural attacks (magic, vampire powers, curses, etc.).

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Supernatural armor = Desperation rating
- Applies only to supernatural attacks
- Stacks with mundane armor
- Always active while artifact is on your person

**When To Use:**
- **Vampire powers** - Resist mesmerism, strength
- **Magic attacks** - Deflect spells and curses
- **Supernatural harm** - Reduce damage from entities
- **Curse resistance** - Artifact protects from hexes

**Strategy Notes:**
- Defensive complement to Enchanted Weapon
- Better with high Desperation
- Essential for frontline supernatural combat
- Doesn't help vs mundane attacks (guns, knives)

**Example:**
```
Vampire attempts to dominate your mind (supernatural attack)
Normal: Resist with Willpower
Protective Aura: Add Desperation 3 as bonus
Resistance: Resolve 2 + Composure 3 + Desperation 3 = 8 dice
/roll pool:8 difficulty:3 comment:Resisting vampire mesmerism
Success: Artifact's aura shields your mind
Vampire's power slides off the mystical protection
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Artifact perk:Protective Aura
```

---

### Power Channeling

**What It Does:**
Channel supernatural energy through the artifact to enhance your actions. Spend Willpower to add bonus dice equal to your Desperation to any roll involving the artifact.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Cost: 1 Willpower

- Duration: One action
- Can be used for attacks, defense, or mystical actions

**When To Use:**

**Strategy Notes:**

- Manage Willpower carefully

**Example:**
```
Final strike against vampire elder (must kill or die)
Power Channeling: Spend 1 Willpower
Attack: Melee 5 + Str 4 + Desperation 4 = 13 dice
/roll pool:13 difficulty:2 comment:Channeled power strike
Result: 8 successes, margin 6
Massive aggravated damage, vampire destroyed
Artifact blazes with mystical fire
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Artifact perk:Power Channeling
```

---

### Mystical Sense

**What It Does:**
The artifact resonates in the presence of supernatural entities and magic. It warns you of nearby threats, detects magic, and pulses when supernatural creatures approach.

**Detection Capabilities:**
- **Proximity warning** - Supernatural entities nearby
- **Magic detection** - Active spells and rituals
- **Resonance** - Stronger pulse for greater threats
- **Direction** - Artifact points toward source
- **Nature identification** - Type of supernatural (vampire, demon, magic, etc.)

**When To Use:**
- **Ambush prevention** - Detect hidden supernatural enemies
- **Investigation** - Find magical evidence
- **Threat assessment** - Identify supernatural presence
- **Ritual detection** - Sense ongoing magic

**Strategy Notes:**
- Passive detection (always active)
- Complements Senses Edge
- Essential for investigation builds
- Prevents surprise by supernatural

**Example:**
```
Entering abandoned warehouse
Mystical Sense: Artifact grows cold and pulls left
Storyteller: "Your artifact resonates - vampires nearby, at least 3"
Direction indicated: Left side, upper floor
You prepare for ambush before entering
Intelligence gathered through mystical awareness
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Artifact perk:Mystical Sense
```

---

### Legacy Power

**What It Does:**
Unlock the artifact's true power: a unique supernatural ability tied to its history and nature. Work with Storyteller to define this power based on artifact's origin.

**Example Legacy Powers:**
- **Holy Blade:** Once per session, call down divine light to banish demons/vampires
- **Ancient Grimoire:** Cast ritual spells from the book's pages
- **Cursed Gun:** Bullets always find supernatural hearts, never miss
- **Saint's Relic:** Heal all wounds once per session through faith
- **Demon's Knife:** Consume souls of defeated enemies to power artifact

**When To Use:**
- **Crisis moments** - Ultimate power for desperate situations
- **Boss fights** - Unleash full artifact potential
- **Unique solutions** - Powers mundane means can't replicate
- **Defining moments** - Artifact's legend grows

**Strategy Notes:**
- Most powerful and unique perk
- Heavily Storyteller-dependent
- Defines artifact's identity
- Limited use (once per session or Willpower-gated)

**Example:**
```
Holy sword's Legacy Power: "Smite Evil"
Once per session, channel divine wrath
Effect: Next attack deals 5 automatic aggravated damage + rolled damage
Use: Final battle with vampire lord
Attack normally: 4 successes = 4 aggravated
Legacy Power: +5 automatic = 9 total aggravated
Vampire lord immolated by holy fire
Artifact's true purpose fulfilled
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Artifact perk:Legacy Power
```
