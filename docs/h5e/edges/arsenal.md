# Arsenal 🔫

Always armed. Always equipped. Always ready.

Arsenal represents a Hunter's access to weapons, military equipment, and armaments. Whether through military connections, black market contacts, or supernatural providence, you always have the tools of war at your disposal.

---

## Overview

### What is Arsenal?

Arsenal is an **Asset Edge** that grants access to weapons, ammunition, armor, and military equipment. You can procure firearms, explosives, tactical gear, and specialized armaments that would be difficult or impossible for civilians to obtain.

The Edge operates on a simple principle: **you always have what you need when you need it**. Run out of ammo mid-fight? Arsenal provides. Need a specific weapon for a vampire lord? Arsenal delivers. Want untraceable gear? Arsenal ensures it.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Combat specialists** - Soldiers, mercenaries, fighters
- **Avengers** - Armed vengeance seekers
- **Zealots** - Holy warriors with righteous fury
- **Tactical Hunters** - Military-minded strategists

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle focuses on social intrigue (weapons won't help)
- Storyteller restricts weapon access heavily
- You prefer supernatural/mystical Edges
- Combat is rare in your game

### Key Strengths

- **Always armed** - Never caught without a weapon
- **Equipment advantage** - Superior firepower over enemies
- **Team support** - Equip your entire cell
- **Tactical flexibility** - Right tool for every threat
- **Professional grade** - Military-quality equipment

### Limitations

- **Doesn't improve skill** - Still need Firearms/Melee dots
- **Requires justification** - Must explain procurement
- **Attention risk** - Heavy weapons draw notice
- **Situation-dependent** - Useless in purely social scenes
- **Storyteller discretion** - What you can access varies

## All Perks

### Team Requisition

**What It Does:**
When you successfully procure a weapon using Arsenal, you can provide copies of that weapon to your allies equal to your margin of success.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Roll to acquire weapon (usually Manipulation + Streetwise or relevant skill)
- Margin = Successes - Difficulty
- Provide that many copies to allies

**When To Use:**
- **Before major combat** - Arm your entire cell
- **Assault missions** - Everyone needs the same weapon
- **Tactical operations** - Coordinated loadouts
- **Emergency situations** - Quick mass armament

**Strategy Notes:**
- Best with high Manipulation or Streetwise
- Coordinate with your cell on needed weapons
- Plan equipment before missions
- Build margin by specializing in procurement

**Example:**
```
You need shotguns for a ghoul nest assault.
Roll: Manipulation 3 + Streetwise 3 = 6 dice, Difficulty 2
Result: 4 successes, Margin 2
You acquire 3 shotguns (one for you + 2 for allies)
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/edge edge:Arsenal
/perks edge:Arsenal perk:Team Requisition
```

### Special Features

Your weapons have special features, modifications, or enhancements. The number of features equals your margin of success when procuring the weapon.

```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Arsenal perk:Special Features
```

---

### Exotics

**What It Does:**
You can procure rare, one-of-a-kind, or extremely difficult-to-obtain weapons. Military prototypes, historical artifacts, experimental technology, or black market rarities.

**Examples:**
- **Prototype Railgun** - Experimental energy weapon
- **Flamethrower** - Area denial and fire damage
- **Rocket Launcher** - Anti-vehicle and anti-structure
- **Minigun** - Suppressive fire, massive ammunition
- **Crossbow** - Silent, reusable, medieval
- **Katana** - Masterwork blade
- **Holy Relic Sword** - Blessed melee weapon
- **Vampiric Blade** - Drains life force
- **Ghostly Ammunition** - Affects incorporeal entities
- **EMP Device** - Disable electronics

**When To Use:**
- **Unique threats** - One-time specialized weapons
- **Climactic battles** - Bring out the big guns
- **Impossible odds** - Need extraordinary firepower
- **Storyteller approval** - Discuss availability

**Strategy Notes:**
- Save for major confrontations
- Discuss with Storyteller beforehand
- Justify narratively (how did you get this?)
- Consequences likely (attention, heat, investigation)

**Example:**
```
Fighting an ancient vampire lord in his castle
Procure: Blessed flamethrower
Justification: Former military chaplain contact
Effect: Fire damage + holy damage, area effect
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Arsenal perk:Exotics
```

---

### Untraceable

**What It Does:**
Your weapons never lead back to you. Serial numbers are filed off, ballistic evidence is inconclusive, and ownership trails vanish. Law enforcement cannot connect you to your armaments through forensic investigation.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Weapons leave no legal trail
- Ballistics don't match
- Purchase history erased
- No registration
- Shell casings untraceable

**When To Use:**
- **After firefights** - No legal consequences
- **Police investigations** - Avoid arrest
- **Maintaining cover** - Stay off radar
- **Public incidents** - No blowback

**Strategy Notes:**
- Essential for Defenders (protect identity)
- Critical for public-facing Hunters
- Pairs with Contacts Edge (police informants)
- Allows reckless weapon use without consequences

**Example:**
```
Shootout with ghouls in public park
Police recover shell casings and bullets
Ballistics come back inconclusive - no match to any weapon
Your Arsenal weapons are untraceable - no investigation
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Arsenal perk:Untraceable
```

---

### Backup Piece

**What It Does:**
Once per scene, produce a hidden weapon that wasn't detected by searches, security, or enemies. Pull a holdout pistol, reveal a hidden knife, or produce emergency armament from seemingly nowhere.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Once per scene (resets after combat/scene ends)
- Weapon must be concealable (pistol, knife, stake)
- Bypasses searches and security
- Narrative surprise element

**When To Use:**
- **Captured** - Disarmed but not helpless
- **Security checkpoints** - Get past metal detectors
- **Social events** - Armed at galas and meetings
- **Desperate moments** - Last-resort weapon

**Strategy Notes:**
- Save for emergencies
- Don't reveal unless necessary
- Pairs with Pickpocket or Subterfuge
- Great narrative moment

**Example:**
```
Captured by vampire coterie, disarmed and bound
Scene: Interrogation in vampire haven
Action: Produce hidden stake from boot
Result: Surprise attack, escape opportunity
```

**Herald Commands:**
```
/perks edge:Arsenal perk:Backup Piece
```

Arsenal operates narratively. When you need a weapon:

1. **Describe what you need** - "I need silver bullets for werewolves"
2. **Storyteller sets difficulty** - Usually 2-3
3. **Roll procurement** - Manipulation + Streetwise typically
4. **Apply Perks** - Team Requisition for copies, Special Features for modifications
5. **Narrate acquisition** - Where/how you got it

**Example Sequence:**
```
You: "I need to arm the cell with assault rifles for the ghoul nest assault."
Storyteller: "Okay, Manipulation + Streetwise, Difficulty 3"
/roll pool:6 difficulty:3 comment:Procuring assault rifles
Result: 5 successes, Margin 2
With Team Requisition: 3 assault rifles (you + 2 allies)
With Special Features: Each has extended mags and tactical lights
```
