# Fame ⭐

Everyone knows your name. Everyone knows your face. Use it.

Fame represents a Hunter's celebrity status and public recognition. Whether you're a local personality, social media influencer, professional athlete, actor, musician, or public figure, people recognize you - and that recognition is power.

---

## Overview

### What is Fame?

Fame is an **Asset Edge** that grants the benefits and burdens of public recognition. You're a known figure with media presence, public platform, and the ability to leverage your celebrity for influence, access, and resources.

The Edge operates on **social capital through recognition**: people know who you are, care what you think, and want to associate with you. This opens doors, grants audiences, and provides influence - but also means you're always being watched.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Social characters** - Charisma/Manipulation builds
- **Public-facing concepts** - Celebrities, influencers, athletes
- **Redeemers** - Use platform for good
- **Infiltrators** - Fame gets you anywhere
- **Media manipulators** - Control narratives

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your concept is covert/secretive (Fame conflicts with stealth)
- You prefer staying under the radar
- Your Storyteller doesn't want celebrity mechanics
- Fame doesn't fit the chronicle tone

### Key Strengths

- **Instant recognition** - Everyone knows you
- **Access everywhere** - VIP treatment automatically
- **Social influence** - People listen to celebrities
- **Media platform** - Shape public opinion
- **Resources** - Money and connections through fame

### Limitations

- **Always watched** - No privacy, hard to operate covertly
- **Reputation matters** - Scandals damage effectiveness
- **Context-dependent** - Fame doesn't help in all situations
- **High maintenance** - Must maintain public image
- **Target** - Enemies know where to find you

## All Perks

### Instant Recognition

**What It Does:**
People immediately recognize you and treat you with deference, excitement, or favoritism. You receive VIP treatment, bypass minor obstacles through celebrity status, and get people's attention automatically.

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Automatic positive first impression
- Bypass queues, waiting, minor bureaucracy
- People want to help/please you
- Advantage on initial social rolls

**When To Use:**
- **Getting past security** - "Don't you know who I am?"
- **Social situations** - Instant credibility
- **Gaining audiences** - Meet important people
- **Resource access** - VIP service

**Strategy Notes:**
- Works best in your area of fame (local celebrity vs. international star)
- May backfire (sometimes you want anonymity)
- Context matters (rural area may not recognize you)
- Pairs with Charisma and Persuasion

**Example:**
```
Trying to get into exclusive club to meet a contact
Normally: Long wait, strict door policy
With Instant Recognition: Bouncer recognizes you, immediate entry, comp table
Door opens automatically because you're famous
```

### Media Platform

**What It Does:**
You have access to media channels - social media following, press contacts, broadcast opportunities - allowing you to shape narratives, spread information, or control public perception.

```

```
/perks edge:Fame perk:Media Platform
```

### Entourage

**What It Does:**
You have a group of loyal followers, fans, assistants, or hangers-on who can provide support, assistance, or cover. They're not combat-trained, but they're devoted to you.

**Entourage Members:**
- **Personal assistant** - Handles logistics
- **Manager** - Deals with business
- **Bodyguard** - Basic protection (not supernatural combat)
- **Fans** - Provide alibis, information, support

**Strategy Notes:**

- They can be targeted by enemies
- Must maintain loyalty (treat them well)
- Useful for non-combat support

**Example:**
```
Need to disappear for a day (hunting vampires)
Entourage: Manager provides cover story (sick, vacation)
Fans create alibi (saw you at different location via social media)
Personal assistant handles cancellations and rescheduling
You're free to Hunt
```

**Herald Commands:**
```

```
