# Pickpocket 🤏

Sleight of hand. Misdirection. What's yours is mine.

Pickpocket represents supernatural skill at theft, misdirection, and sleight of hand. You can steal anything from anyone, plant evidence undetected, and manipulate objects with impossible precision. Nothing is safe from your fingers.

---

## Overview

### What is Pickpocket?

Pickpocket is an **Aptitude Edge** that grants superhuman dexterity and misdirection for theft, planting items, and manipulation. When you invoke Pickpocket, your hands move faster than eyes can track, and your misdirection is supernaturally effective.

The Edge operates through **supernatural dexterity**: fingers that move impossibly fast, attention manipulation that makes people ignore your actions, and precision that defies human limits.

### Who Should Take This Edge?

**Ideal For:**
- **Infiltrators** - Steal keys, plant bugs
- **Thieves** - Professional criminals turned Hunter
- **Investigators** - Plant evidence, steal intel
- **Redeemers** - Non-violent conflict resolution
- **High Dexterity builds** - Maximize manual precision

**Consider Carefully If:**
- Your chronicle doesn't involve theft/infiltration
- You prefer direct approaches
- You have low Dexterity
- Storyteller restricts theft mechanics

### Key Strengths

- **Perfect theft** - Steal anything undetected
- **Evidence planting** - Frame enemies or create alibis
- **Infiltration** - Steal keys, badges, codes
- **Combat utility** - Disarm, steal weapons
- **Non-lethal** - Resolve conflicts without killing

### Limitations

- **Situational** - Not useful in all scenarios
- **Non-combat** - Doesn't help in fights directly
- **Requires targets** - Need people/objects to manipulate
- **Storyteller permission** - What you can steal varies
- **Moral complications** - Theft has consequences
